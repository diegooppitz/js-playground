# Weather App - Next.js Example

## Getting Started

To run this app, you will need an **API_KEY** from [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

### Steps:

1. Sign up at [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and generate a free API key.
2. Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
3. Copy the structure from `.env.example` and paste your API key like this:

   ```env
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here

After that run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
