# HashMap POC

This repository contains a simple Proof of Concept (POC) to study how a HashMap works in JavaScript.

## Purpose

The purpose is to explore and understand the concept of a HashMap and how to implement a basic version in JavaScript. This POC serves as a study of how to store key-value pairs with essential operations like adding, retrieving, and removing elements.

## Project Structure

The project includes:

- **HashMap Class**: Implements basic hashmap operations, including:
  - `put(key, value)`: Adds a new key-value pair to the hashmap.
  - `get(key)`: Retrieves the value associated with a key.
  - `remove(key)`: Removes a key-value pair by key.
  - `hash(key)`: A simple hashing function to map keys to indices.
